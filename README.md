# hello-world
My first repository.

Hello to whoever it is that is taking a look at my GitHub profile or what not.
I really do not know the full potential of this website but I intend to attempt to figure that out.
As of this moment (Oct. 10, 2021) I know Racket and Python.
I look forward to working on learning languages such as Javascript and C#
